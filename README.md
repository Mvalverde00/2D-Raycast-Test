# 2D-Raycast-Test

This project was a simple test to see if I could implement a raycasting system.  The user controls a point-particle which emits light rays in all directions, which should stop when hitting a wall.  It can produce some cool effects to look at.  There is a possibility that I use this feature in a game in the future.
